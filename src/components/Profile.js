      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p className="about-me-content">
        Ive been working with software since 2010. Ive worked as Business Analyst, Product Manager, Development Lead and currently work as a Delivery Lead for an Australian tech company.

        I love how scalable software is and how we can use it to solve problems and create opportunities for people and organisations.

        Now Im learning how to code in a 24 week long coding bootcamp, to enable myself to become more self-sufficient and to open up more opportunities for my future. 

        Have a look around and reach out if anything here interests you.
